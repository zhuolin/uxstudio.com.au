      <p>The role of the UX designer is changing. With new production methodologies such as lean and agile more emphasis is being placed on collaboration and rapid design exploration. To meet these changes UX designers roles are evolving to become facilitators and experimenters.</p>
      <p>This workshop will help you improve the ways in which you collaborate with different disciplines and turn dull meetings in to fun and creative experiences.  You will learn the power that ‘play’ has to unlock creativity and better group dynamics as well as structured activities to establish relationships. The workshop will teach fun and engaging methods that help turn even the most jaded stake holder into a design advocate. The workshop will cover techniques such as sketch ups & white boarding, simple exercises to improve your sketching skills, creative games, 6 ups sketching, dot scoring, 6 hat thinking, affinity sorting and getting the most out of participants.</p>
